# Calculator

The goal of this project is to create a browser-based calculator using html, css and javascript.

The first phase involves making functions for basic mathematical operations. An operate function takes an operator and calls the appropriate function for calculation. 

Next phases wants us to make the display of the calculator itself on the browser using html and css. We then move on to implement js so the buttons of the calculator work. I also added scripts to avoid overflowing the display of the results, as well as a clear button to reset the calculator. A message is displayed if the user attempts to divide by zero. The calculator can only operate on 2 numbers at a time (as intended). 

For extra credit, a decimal and backspace button and keyboard support were added to the project
